Steps:

1.Preprocessed the data, identified the categorical multi-class labels which is the part of features and target column
2.Used CategoricalImputer for treating missing values
3.Encoded the categorical data using label encoder and than used Binary encoder for taking each category as a separate column.
Since there is no ordering of category so we need to convert them into separate column.
(BinaryEncoder will take less memory as compared to OneHotEncoder)
4.splitted the data into train/test with 75/25 %.
5.Created a decision tree model as this was giving better result than RandomForest,Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, Svc
6.Validated the model using some metrices confusion metric and also computed the accuracy.
7.Predicted the output of the test data provided using the model trained.
